## Task 1: ANN

For this task, I build a fully connect feed-forward ANN model for a multi-label regression problem.

I did proper data preprocessing, design the ANN model, 
then fine-tune your model architecture (number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, learning rate, momentum, regularization).

I was working with the data in Task 1.csv for predicting students' scores in 3 different exams: math, reading and writing. The columns include:

## Task 2: CNN 

For this task, I was doing image classification:

First, adapting  model from Task 1 to work on this task, and fit it on the new data. Then, evaluate its performance.

After that, build a CNN model for image classification.

Compare both models in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and speed of inference (the time the model takes to predict 50 samples).

I was working with the data in triple_mnist.zip for predicting 3-digit numbers writen in the image. 
Each image contains 3 digits similar to the following example (whose label is 039)

## Task 3: Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning (15%)

For the loan_data.csv data, predict if the bank should give a loan or not. I needed to do the following:

Fine-tune a decision tree on the data
Fine-tune a random forest on the data
Compare their performance
Visualize your DT and one of the trees from the RF
